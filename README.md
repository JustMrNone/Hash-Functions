# Hashlib and Hash Functions 

## the files can be used in these ways:'
-python ranbowtablemaker.py filename takes a .txt file and give the rainbow table in .csv

- python hash.py gives you the list of available algoritms

- python hash.py file.txt hashfunction(e.g sha256) takes file and hashfunction as input and produces output 

## or run:

- python anotherhash.py to pass the values it as a string
- enter show algorithms as the first argument to see algorithms 


feel free to optimize and refine the code
fork and I will add it
